## Overview

Here we tested a Model of machine learning to show if it can acurately predict the correct stock price of the future versus using the closing prices.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the model that used the closing prices for the data had less loss in the model and therefore more accuracy with its prediction. See plots below.
